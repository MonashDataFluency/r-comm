## Today's Objectives

* use knitr, rmarkdown and bookdown R packages to build various document types including PDF, HTML and DOCX
* work with git version control tool
* create reproducible and “backed up” analysis via remote repositories (e.g github)

What We Aren't Learning:

* How to code in R itself

## Reproducibility Crisis

## Why Use R/Rmarkdown

- It's free legally & continous active development
- Low risk of inadvertent data loss/mutation.
  * By design, R requires you to load your data in, what you do with the data is then written in code (R language)
- Collaborative: share your data and analysis

## Why Use R/Rmarkdown

[Well developed ecosystem](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/) of software packages that expands base R for data analysis, project management, visualisation, document generation, etc

## Reproducible Analysis

* Document what you've done with your data in code
* Maintain software versions used for the analysis 
* Track changes to your analysis with version control
