reproduciblity discussion notes:
  
Where do you store your raw data?

Where do you store the files associated with your analysis?

Do you keep track of what software version you are using?

Does the analysis software allow you to save the analysis to a file or is it point and click?

Point n click vs code based analysis

Importance of recording which software versions used

Keep your analysis in one place

Backup your raw data - ALWAYS

Can you rerun the analysis on the same data and get the same result as originally reported?

Can someone else pick up your analysis and run it and get the same result as originally reported?

Will the analysis work on new data?

## Tips For Reproducible Analysis

Before you start your analysis, think about how:

If you & another person are working together on an analysis, how do you ensure that changes are tracked between the two of you?

How do you future-proof an analysis so that you can come back to it years and:

A) Rerun it and get the same original answer

B) Understand why you did x, y and z in the analysis

C) How easy is it to repeat the analysis on new data?*

*This is verging on writing an R package and putting it out for the community's use but honestly - I'd be pretty happy if people just included the code that did the analysis in their paper rather than doing software development

How do you future-proof an analysis so that you can come back to it years given that:

* Future You isn't going to remember every step of an analysis: document your analysis
* Software packages: updates, deprecation - will the tools you used now be available later?*
* How easy is it to share your code/data for someone else** to run and duplicate the analysis

*This is actually pretty important and we don't cover it in this workshop - R has the Packrat package to sorta address this but I'm not sure it's a complete solution
**Someone else is often you two years from now
Basically, try to be kind to future you and others
