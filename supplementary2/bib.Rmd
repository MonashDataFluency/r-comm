#### Fields

[Up](#TOP "up")\

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| []{#address} [address](#TOP "up") | Usually the address of the        |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For major publishing houses,\     |
|                                   | just give the city. For small     |
|                                   | publishers, specifying the        |
|                                   | complete address might help the   |
|                                   | reader.                           |
